**=========================================Welcome to Deadline!===================================================**

Thank you for checking out Deadline! my first attempt at a side scrolling game.

This game was created for a project during professional training, and of course because it is fun!
The premise of the game is two zombies rushing to submit their work to the big boss zombie before the other. 
Hence the title "Deadline!".

The rules of the game are simple - 

1. Each player has three keys. Two for walking and one for biting. 
   Each "left and right foot" key must be alternated in order to walk forwards.

2. Humans will occasional run past the zombies in an effort to escape. 
   Don't let them! Not only are humans yummy, but they will also give you a boost forward, towards your goal.. the finish line, where your boss is waiting. 
   Bite humans with the "bite" key when they are next to your zombie, but be aware, humans are fast!

3. Walking is really hard work for zombies, their stamina runs out fast, so munch as many humans as you can to give you the winning edge!
   Each zombie's stamina is displayed on the "stamina bar" at the top of the page.
